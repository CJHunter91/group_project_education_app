'Repeat it to Keep it' is an app made during the week long JavaScript project
at CodeClan. With a log-in system being beyond our current understanding, this
was meant to model the internal workings of an educational app based on the
principle of flash cards. To get the app running on a local machine, the
following steps are necessary:


### Installing

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run a mongoDB server (leave running in a terminal window):

```
mongod
```

Run webpack (leave running in a terminal window):

```
npm run build
```

Run express (leave running in a terminal window):

```
npm run server (for development, 'npm run server:dev')
```

### Using

The application is running on port 3000 so visit http://localhost:3000/.
